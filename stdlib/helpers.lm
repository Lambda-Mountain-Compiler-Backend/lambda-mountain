# LM provides a concept of open vs closed structures
# a closed structure may always be referred to by a single pointer
# a closed structure may exist on the stack or the heap or even a file or mapped network resource
# an open structure by comparison is thought to exist in the registers
# multiple structures may be open at the same time as long as they don't conflict
# fields of open structures are referred to by their ordered position $0, $1, $2
# a mapping of registers is then applied to these field positions
# x.$0 = %rdi
# y.$3 = %r10
# etc.

# for the bootstrap compiler, only one expression will be open at a time

# S-Expressions are a common datastructure used heavily in the bootstrap compiler
# Not all structures need to be S-Expressions, but they will always be available
# Aside from the usual Cons,Atom,Nil information there is also a reference counter and some flags
#
# struct S {
#   $0 ref_counter : u64
#   $1 atom        : *char
#   $2 head        : *S
#   $3 tail        : *S
#   $4 flags       : bool[64]
# }
