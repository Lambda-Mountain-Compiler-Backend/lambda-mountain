# [Lambda Mountain](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/wiki)

λ☶ (pronounced Lambda Mountain) is a compiler backend.
It is a typed fragment assembler,
which means it could generate machine code,
but right now the only backend targets GNU Assembler.

More information is available on the [λ☶ Wiki](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/wiki).

There is also a [Bootstrap Book](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/BootstrapBook) that explains the compiler internals in great detail.
