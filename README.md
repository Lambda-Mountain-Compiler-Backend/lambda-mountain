### Not Your Average Assembler

Despite being an assembler, LM provides
* self-hosting (LM is written in LM)
* algebraic data types
* parameterized code and data
* hygienic macros
* platform agnostic standard libraries

### Why Such a Small Codebase?

LM is currently about 4000 lines of code.
LM solves an N by M Problem with language frontends vs language backends.
The LM project might interface with larger codebases that define frontends or backends, but the core LM Calculus can stay small.

### What is a Fragment Assembler?

An assembler takes pieces of data and sticks them together. Assemblers don't always understand the meaning of what they do, they just do it.

A fragment is a Key-Value Map of Strings to S-Expressions. This data structure permits more detailed manipulation of code than a typical assembler.
