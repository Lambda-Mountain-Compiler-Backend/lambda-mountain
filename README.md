# [Lambda Mountain](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/wiki)

LM aims to provide a convenient interface to formally encode a variety of big-step semantics.
This project is a **User Inferface** for existing theoretical frameworks.
The text language here is a simple encoding of lambda calculus and types.
There is also a concept of equivalence relations formed by big-step rules.
